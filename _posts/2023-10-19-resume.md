I am currently a Research Assistant at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

My research interests include low-level vision, especially the **Image Super-Resolution** task.

I got my M.Sc degree from the **School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UESTC** in June 2023. Earlier, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the **School of Electronic and Information, Sichuan University** in June 2020.

My girlfriend Wanmin Wu is currently working toward the Ph.D degree in the school of Information and Communication Engineering, UESTC.
